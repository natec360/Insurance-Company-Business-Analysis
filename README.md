For Q1 2023 (and to a lesser extent, Q1 2022), there is a significant drop in retention (~ -80 pp). This looks like seasonality since this pattern occurs across multiple cohorts, where the cohort start date is in Q1. From a business perspective, this is probably due to people looking at their subscriptions at the beginning and end of each year and cancelling.

New analysis: A/B test retention outcomes when adjusting the following criteria on all available user attributes (credit, claims, age, etc.). Additional useful data (to conduct aforementioned tests on) could include:

Premium size
Payment/billing method 
Contact frequency with customer service (# of service tickets)
Policy changes within the first 3 months

Other analyses: After doing this, may be worth completing the data for marital status, occupation, and other demographic fields to identify other product offerings. 

I recommend experimenting and launching a mid-policy engagement campaign personalized check-ins or policy reviews around week 25). This would help preempt cancellations, especially for Q1 cohorts, by reminding users of value, offering re-quotes, or suggesting bundle savings. This could improve retention where seasonal dips occur too. In other words, I am suggesting a customer lifecycle marketing campaign to ensure engagement at the critical inflection point in retaining and churning a customer.
