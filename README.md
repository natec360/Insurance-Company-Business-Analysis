For Q1 2023 (and to a lesser extent, Q1 2022), there is a significant drop in retention (~ -80 pp). This looks like seasonality since this pattern occurs across multiple cohorts, where the cohort start date is in Q1. From a business perspective, this is probably due to people looking at their subscriptions at the beginning and end of each year and cancelling.
